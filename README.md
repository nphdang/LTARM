# Lattice-based Temporal Association Rule Mining (LTARM)
This is the implementation of the LTARM method in the paper "LTARM: A novel temporal association rule mining method to understand toxicities in a routine cancer treatment" published in Knowledge-Based Systems 2018.

# Installation
Download and install .NET Framework 4.0

# How to run
1. Run "LTARM.exe".
2. Specify "minSup" (the minimum support threshold), "minDirConf" (the minimum direction confidence threshold), and "gap" (the time frame).
3. Click the "Discover" button.
4. The "Patients" textbox indicates the number of transactions in the dataset.
